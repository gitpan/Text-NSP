tscore.pm Version 0.1

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Statistical library package to calculate the T-score. This
package should be used with statistic.pl and rank.pl.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Assume that the frequency count data associated with a bigram 
<word1><word2> is stored in a 2x2 contingency table:

          word2   ~word2
  word1    n11      n12 | n1p
 ~word1    n21      n22 | n2p
           --------------
           np1      np2   npp

where n11 is the number of times <word1><word2> occur together, and
n12 is the number of times <word1> occurs with some word other than
word2, and n1p is the number of times in total that word1 occurs as
the first word in a bigram. 

The T-score is defined as a ratio of difference between the observed
and the expected mean to the variance of the sample. Note that this
is a variant of the standard t-test that was proposed for use in the
identification of collocations in large samples of text. 

Thus, the T-score is defined as follows:

    m11 = n1p * np1 / npp
    
    T-score = (n11 - m11)/sqrt(n11)
