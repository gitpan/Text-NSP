=over

=item 

Fixed bug in statistic.pl which caused long form of pmi (Text::NSP::Measures::3D::MI::pmi)
not to be handled correctly on the command line, and that caused pmi_exp 
not to be properly initialize when using the long form of pmi.

  Reported here : <L http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ngram/message/240>

=item  

Added nsp-stoplist.regex to distribution (in /Text-NSP/bin/utils), to 
serve as a default stoplist.

  Reported here : <L http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ngram/message/280>

=item 

Fixed link to class diagram in FAQ.pod. 

  Reported here : <L http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ngram/message/230>

=item 

Fixed documentation Text::NSP::Measures::3D::MI::pmi to correctly show 
how we are computing expected values. 

  Reported here : <L http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ngram/message/290>

=item

preparng this release

=item 1.09

Released March 26, 2008 all changes by TDP

=over

=item 

Spell checked the modules

=item 

Relaxed test cases 27, 29 for ll, 20 for x2, and 13 for phi, due to 
arithmetic differences on 64 bit architectures

=item

Modified Makefile.PL to go back to more standard methods of testing and 
installation. 

=item

Modified structure of /t directory for 'make test'. It appears that the 
use of subdirectories in /t with test cases might have been causing 
problems for Windows testing, so we have moved all test files to the top 
level of /t, and also removed the TEST program so that things are called 
in a more standard or generic fashion.

=back

=item 1.07

Released March 24, 2008 all changes by TDP

=over

=item

Updated Makefile.PL to no longer require 5.8.5 - have dropped back to 5.6

=item

Updated FAQ with some explanation of ALL-TESTS.sh

=item

Renamed /docs as /doc to be consistent with other packages

=item

Added descriptive labels in POD in NAME field of .pl programs to provide 
that info on CPAN display

=item 

Fixed duplicate Copyright message bug in documentation of Measures.pm

=item

Removed "help" messages from Makefile.PL execution so as to (hopefully) 
avoid problems with installations on Windows.

=item

Corrected error in INSTALL instructions - csh ./ALL-TESTS.sh must be 
performed after 'make install'

=back

=item 1.05 

Released March 20, 2008 all changes by TDP

=over

=item

Fixed problem with file Testing/statistic/t2 would appear 
(mysteriously) but not be in the MANIFEST. This file was left behind 
during /Testing/statistic/normal-op.sh and is now being removed.


=item

Fixed problem in /Testing where .sh files are sometimes not executable. 
Those files are now invoked via 'csh test.sh' rather than './test.sh', 
meaning that they no longer need to be executable.

=item

Fixed ticket number 24061 from rt.cpan.org regarding incorrect 
version information coming from Measures.pm

=item 

Archived all old ChangeLogs to doc/ChangeLogs directory. Began to use 
pod in CHANGES directory instead

=item 

Added doc/update-pod.sh to automatically refresh top level read only 
documentation including README, CHANGES, TODO and INSTALL

=item 

Fixed Makefile.PL to avoid problems during Windows install. This 
problem and fix was reported by Richard Churchill to the ngram mailing 
list. This may also address ticket #20371 from rt.cpan.org. 

=item 

Modified Makefile.PL to allow for use of 'make dist' and also creation 
of META.yml
