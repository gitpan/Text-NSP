=item 1.05 

Released March 20, 2008 all changes by TDP

=over

=item

Fixed problem with file Testing/statistic/t2 would appear 
(mysteriously) but not be in the MANIFEST. This file was left behind 
during /Testing/statistic/normal-op.sh and is now being removed.


=item

Fixed problem in /Testing where .sh files are sometimes not executable. 
Those files are now invoked via 'csh test.sh' rather than './test.sh', 
meaning that they no longer need to be executable.

=item

Fixed ticket number 24061 from rt.cpan.org regarding incorrection 
version information coming from Measures.pm

=item 

Archived all old ChangeLogs to doc/ChangeLogs directory. Began to use 
pod in CHANGES directory instead

Added doc/update-pod.sh to automatically refresh top level read only 
documentation including README, CHANGES, TODO and INSTALL

=item 

Fixed Makefile.PL to avoid problems during Windows install. This 
problem and fix was reported by Richard Churchill to the ngram mailing 
list. This may also address ticket #20371 from rt.cpan.org. 

=item 

Modified Makefile.PL to allow for use of 'make dist' and also creation 
of META.yml
