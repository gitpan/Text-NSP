=head1 NAME

Text::NSP::Measures::3D - Perl module that provides basic framework for
                          building measure of association for trigrams.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module can be used as a foundation for building 3-dimensional
measures of association that can then be used by statistic.pl. In
particular this module provides methods that give convenient access to
3-d (i.e., trigram) frequency counts as created by count.pl, as well as
some degree of error handling that verifies the data.


=head3 Basic Usage

  use Text::NSP::Measures::3D::MI::ll;

  my $ll = Text::NSP::Measures::3D::MI::ll->new();

  my $npp = 60; my $n1p = 20; my $np1 = 20;  my $n11 = 10;

  $ll_value = $ll->calculateStatistic( n11=>$n11,
                                      n1p=>$n1p,
                                      np1=>$np1,
                                      npp=>$npp);

  if( ($errorCode = $ll->getErrorCode()))
  {
    print STDERR $erroCode." - ".$ll->getErrorMessage();
  }
  else
  {
    print $ll->getStatisticName."value for trigram is ".$ll_value;
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The methods in this module retrieve observed trigram frequency counts and
marginal totals, and also compute expected values. They also provide
support for error checking of the output produced by count.pl. These
methods are used in all the trigram (3d) measure modules provided in NSP.
If you are writing your own 3d measure, you can use these methods as well.

With trigram or 3d measures we use a 3x3 contingency table to store the
frequency counts associated with each word in the trigram, as well as the
number of times the trigram occurs. The notation we employ is as follows:

Marginal Frequencies:

 n1pp = the number of trigrams where the first word is word1.
 np1p = the number of trigrams where the second word is word2.
 npp1 = the number of trigrams where the third word is word3
 n2pp = the number of trigrams where the first word is not word1.
 np2p = the number of trigrams where the second word is not word2.
 npp2 = the number of trigrams where the third word is not word3.

Observed Frequencies:

 n111 = number of times word1, word2 and word3 occur together in
        their respective positions, joint frequency.
 n112 = number of times word1 and word2 occur in their respective
        positions but word3 does not.
 n121 = number of times word1 and word3 occur in their respective
        positions but word2 does not.
 n211 = number of times word2 and word3 occur in their respective
        positions but word1 does not.
 n122 = number of times word1 occurs in its respective position
        but word2 and word3 do not.
 n212 = number of times word2 occurs in in its respective position
        but word1 and word3 do not.
 n221 = number of times word3 occurs in its respective position
        but word1 and word2 do not.
 n222 = number of time neither word1, word2 or word3 occur in their
        respective positions.

Expected Frequencies:

 m111 = expected number of times word1, word2 and word3 occur together in
        their respective positions.
 m112 = expected number of times word1 and word2 occur in their respective
        positions but word3 does not.
 m121 = expected number of times word1 and word3 occur in their respective
        positions but word2 does not.
 m211 = expected number of times word2 and word3 occur in their respective
        positions but word1 does not.
 m122 = expected number of times word1 occurs in its respective position
        but word2 and word3 do not.
 m212 = expected number of times word2 occurs in in its respective position
        but word1 and word3 do not.
 m221 = expected number of times word3 occurs in its respective position
        but word1 and word2 do not.
 m222 = expected number of time neither word1, word2 or word3 occur in their
        respective positions.
