=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head3 Basic Usage

  use Text::NSP::Measures::2D::CHI::x2;

  my $x2 = Text::NSP::Measures::2D::CHI::x2->new();

  my $npp = 60; my $n1p = 20; my $np1 = 20;  my $n11 = 10;

  $x2_value = $x2->calculateStatistic( n11=>$n11,
                                      n1p=>$n1p,
                                      np1=>$np1,
                                      npp=>$npp);


  if( ($errorCode = $x2->getErrorCode()))
  {
    print STDERR $erroCode." - ".$x2->getErrorMessage();
  }
  else
  {
    print $x2->getStatisticName."value for bigram is ".$x2_value;
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is the base class for the Chi-squared and Phi coefficient
measures. This module provides error checks specific for these measures,
it also implements the computations that are common to these measures.

=over

=item Pearson's Chi-Squared

  x2 = 2 * [((n11 - m11)/m11)^2 + ((n12 - m12)/m12)^2 +
           ((n21 - m21)/m21)^2 + ((n22 -m22)/m22)^2]

=item Phi Coefficient

 PHI^2 = ((n11 * n22) - (n21 * n21))^2/(n1p * np1 * np2 * n2p)

=item T-Score

 tscore = (n11 - m11)/sqrt(n11)

=back

Note that the value of PHI^2 is equivalent to
Pearson's Chi-Squared test multiplied by the sample size, that is:

 Chi-Squared = npp * PHI^2

 Although T-score seems quite different from the other two measures we
 have put it in the CHI family because like the other two measures it
 uses the difference between the obseved and expected values and is also
 quite similar in ranking the bigrams.

=item calculateStatistic() - This method calls the
computeObservedValues() and the computeExpectedValues() methods to
compute the observed and expected values. It checks thes values for
any errors that might cause the PHI and x2 measures to fail.

to the expected values
