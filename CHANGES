SYNOPSIS
    Revision history for Perl module Text::NSP

DESCRIPTION
    1.05
        Released March 20, 2008 all changes by TDP

        *   Fixed problem with file Testing/statistic/t2 would appear
            (mysteriously) but not be in the MANIFEST. This file was left
            behind during /Testing/statistic/normal-op.sh and is now being
            removed.

        *   Fixed problem in /Testing where .sh files are sometimes not
            executable. Those files are now invoked via 'csh test.sh' rather
            than './test.sh', meaning that they no longer need to be
            executable.

        *   Fixed ticket number 24061 from rt.cpan.org regarding
            incorrection version information coming from Measures.pm

        *   Archived all old ChangeLogs to doc/ChangeLogs directory. Began
            to use pod in CHANGES directory instead

        *   Added doc/update-pod.sh to automatically refresh top level read
            only documentation including README, CHANGES, TODO and INSTALL

        *   Fixed Makefile.PL to avoid problems during Windows install. This
            problem and fix was reported by Richard Churchill to the ngram
            mailing list. This may also address ticket #20371 from
            rt.cpan.org.

        *   Modified Makefile.PL to allow for use of 'make dist' and also
            creation of META.yml
