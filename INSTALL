       NSP is available from three different distribution sites:
	
              http://www.d.umn.edu/~tpederse/nsp.html
              http://sourceforge.net/projects/ngram
              http://search.cpan.org/dist/Text-NSP/

===================================================================

Dependencies:

NSP is a suite of Perl programs. Unless you have really good reasons for  
not doing so, it would make sense to be using a  relatively  recent  
version of Perl. As of this writing that would be 5.8 or better. 

NSP has been developed on the Unix and Linux platforms, but is known to   
run on Windows. In theory it should run on any platform that supports   
Perl, which is most. (http://www.cpan.org/ports/index.html)

There is one Perl module used in NSP, Getopt::Long, which helps us handle 
options in command line processing. It is very likely that this is  
included with your Perl installation, but if not it can be downloaded 
from the CPAN archive (http://search.cpan.org). 

===================================================================

Installation: 

As of version 0.63, there are two methods of installation now supported  
for NSP. 

METHOD 1: 
---------

On Unix/Linux, NSP should be included in your PATH. This is how I set my  
.cshrc file to include NSP if I have downloaded from sourceforge or from
Ted Pedersen's home page. 

set path = ($HOME/nsp-v0.73 $path)
set path = ($HOME/nsp-v0.73/Measures $path)
set path = ($HOME/nsp-v0.73/Utils $path)

If I have downloaded from CPAN, I set these paths as follows:

set path = ($HOME/Text-NSP-0.73 $path)
set path = ($HOME/Text-NSP-0.73/Measures $path)
set path = ($HOME/Text-NSP-0.73/Utils $path)

After doing this, you should be able to run any of the NSP programs from  
any directory. 

METHOD 2: 
---------

Install to a system directory (or a directory you specify via the PREFIX 
option) via the following sequence of commands: 

perl Makefile.PL 
make
make test
make install

The above sequence requires that you have system administrator authority, 
and you will installing in system directories (like /usr/local/ etc.) 
After installing to system directories, it's very likely that you can run
NSP without needing to set any paths explicitly. 

If you do not have such authority, you can install into a directory of  
your own choosing by running (for example):

perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/cs/mydirectory/NSP67
make
make test
make install

Whether installing to a system directory or to a local directory, programs  
you can run (.pl and .sh) will be installed in  /bin, documentation in  
/doc, man pages in /man, and perl modules in /lib. As a part of this 
installation process, html versions of pod documents are created 
automatically.  

You will need to set your path to include the /bin and /lib directory 
locations. These are displayed during the execution of make install, so   
please make a note of them and be sure to set your path accordingly. 

===================================================================

Orientation:

INSTALL         : this file

README          : a plain text version of Docs/README.pod

CHANGES         : a plain text version of Docs/ChangeLog-v0.63.txt

                  (INSTALL, README, and CHANGES are names required
		   by CPAN, hence the naming/renaming)

MANIFEST        : a list of the files found in this distribution,
		  created automatically by "make manifest" and used
	          by Makefile.PL

count.pl 	: program that counts Ngrams in corpora

statistic.pl 	: program that measures association of Ngrams based on 
		  count.pl output

Docs/		: directory of documentation

		  README.pod - complete description of NSP
		  FAQ.pod    - frequently asked questions
	          NewStats.pod - how to implement new measures 
		  Todo.pod   - our list of things to do
		  Usage.pod  - sample usages (very basic)
		  cicling2003.(ps|pdf) - overview of NSP design
	
Measures/	: directory of Perl modules that implement various 
		  measures of association

Utils/		: directory that contains several useful programs

		  rank.pl: compare two measures of association
		  kocos.pl: find kth order co-occurrences
		  combig.pl: find unordered counts of bigrams

Testing/	: directory of test scripts for each program in NSP.
		  You can run these to make sure your installation is
		  working, and also to see some sample usages. Each
		  program tested has its own directory within Testing
		  in which you can find a README.txt file that describes
		  the testing process. Please note that "make test" above
		  does *not* run these tests.  They must be run separately
	          after installation is complete.
