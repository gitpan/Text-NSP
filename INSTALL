    NSP is available from three different distribution sites:

              http://www.d.umn.edu/~tpederse/nsp.html
              http://sourceforge.net/projects/ngram
              http://search.cpan.org/dist/Text-NSP/

===================================================================

Dependencies:

NSP is a suite of Perl programs. We require that you be using Perl 
version 5.8.5 or better. 

NSP has been developed on the Unix and Linux platforms, but is known to
run on Windows. In theory it should run on any platform that supports
Perl, which is most. (http://www.cpan.org/ports/index.html)

There is one Perl module used in NSP, Getopt::Long, which helps us handle
options in command line processing. It is very likely that this is
included with your Perl installation, but if not it can be downloaded
from the CPAN archive (http://search.cpan.org).

===================================================================

Installation:

If you have administrative privileges you can install Ngram Statistics 
Package by running the following commands:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

This will install the module in system directories (like /usr/bin/ etc). In
this case, it's very likely that you will be able to run NSP, without having 
to set any environment variables explicitly.

If you do not have administrative privileges, you can use the PREFIX variable 
to specify a directory to which you have write access, and you can use the  
LIB variable to specify the directory where the platform independent  
modules should be installed, Since NSP is platform independent it will be  
installed directly under ~/lib. If you do not specify the LIB variable the  
NSP modules will be installed under a more complex directory structure.:

perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/mydirectory/NSP LIB=/home/mydirectory/NSP/lib
make
make test
make install

Executable files (.pl and .sh) will be installed in $PREFIX/bin, and Perl 
modules will be installed in $LIB/lib. 

To use Ngram Statistics Package, you will need to set your PATH variable to
include $PREFIX/bin and PERL5LIB variable to include the $LIB/lib  
directory locations. These are displayed during the execution of make  
install, so please make a note of them and be sure to set your  
environment variables accordingly.

Orientation:

INSTALL           : this file

README            : a plain text version of Docs/README.pod

CHANGES           : a plain text version of Docs/ChangeLog-v1.01.txt

                    (INSTALL, README, and CHANGES are names required
                     by CPAN, hence the naming/renaming)

MANIFEST          : a list of the files found in this distribution,
                    created automatically by "make manifest" and used
                    by Makefile.PL

bin/count.pl      : program that counts Ngrams in corpora

bin/statistic.pl  : program that measures association of Ngrams based on
                    count.pl output

Docs/             : directory of documentation

                    README.pod - complete description of NSP
                    FAQ.pod    - frequently asked questions
                    Todo.pod   - our list of things to do
                    Usage.pod  - sample usages (very basic)
                    cicling2003.(ps|pdf) - overview of NSP design
                    NSP-Class-diagram.(png|pdf) - UML of measure hierarchy

bin/Utils/        : directory that contains several useful programs

                    rank.pl: compare two measures of association
                    kocos.pl: find kth order co-occurrences
                    combig.pl: find unordered counts of bigrams

t/                : directory of test scripts that run when "make test"
		    is issued. 

Testing/          : directory of test scripts for each program in NSP.
                    You can run these to make sure your installation is
                    working, and also to see some sample usages. Each
                    program tested has its own directory within Testing
                    in which you can find a README.txt file that describes
                    the testing process. Please note that "make test" above
                    does *not* run these tests.  They must be run separately
                    after installation is complete. This style of testing
                    has mostly been depricated, while we keep these tests
	            running for the new versions, we are putting all of
                    our news tests into t/. 

lib/		  : directory where measures modules are found.
