    NSP is available from three different distribution sites:

              http://www.d.umn.edu/~tpederse/nsp.html
              http://sourceforge.net/projects/ngram
              http://search.cpan.org/dist/Text-NSP/

===================================================================

Dependencies:

NSP is a suite of Perl programs. Unless you have really good reasons for
not doing so, it would make sense to be using a  relatively  recent
version of Perl. As of this writing that would be 5.8 or better.

NSP has been developed on the Unix and Linux platforms, but is known to
run on Windows. In theory it should run on any platform that supports
Perl, which is most. (http://www.cpan.org/ports/index.html)

There is one Perl module used in NSP, Getopt::Long, which helps us handle
options in command line processing. It is very likely that this is
included with your Perl installation, but if not it can be downloaded
from the CPAN archive (http://search.cpan.org).

===================================================================

Installation:

If you have administrative privilages you can install Ngrams Statistics Package
by running the following commands:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

This will install the module in system directories (like /usr/bin/ etc). In
this case, it's very likely that you will be able to run NSP, without having to
set any environment variables explicitly.



If you do not have administrative privilages, you can use the PREFIX variable to
specify a directory to which you have write access, and you can use the LIB
variable to specify the directory where the platform independent modules should
be installed, Since NSP is platform independent it will be installed directly
under ~/lib. If you do not specify the LIB variable the NSP modules will be
installed under a more complex directory structure.:

perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/mydirectory/NSP LIB=/home/mydirectory/NSP/lib
make
make test
make install

This will install the executables(.pl and .sh) under ~/bin, perl modules under
~/lib, documentation under ~/doc, and man pages under the ~/man directory. HTML
versions of the pod documents are also created as a part of this installation
process, and can be found under the ~/html directory.

To use Ngrams Statistics Package, you will need to set your PATH variable to
include ~/bin and PERL5LIB variable to include the ~/lib directory locations.
These are displayed during the execution of make install, so please make a note
of them and be sure to set your environment variables accordingly.

You can also set the MANPATH environment variable to include ~/man directoryt,
so that the NSP documentation is also included in the man search.

===================================================================

Orientation:

INSTALL           : this file

README            : a plain text version of Docs/README.pod

CHANGES           : a plain text version of Docs/ChangeLog-v0.63.txt

                    (INSTALL, README, and CHANGES are names required
                     by CPAN, hence the naming/renaming)

MANIFEST          : a list of the files found in this distribution,
                    created automatically by "make manifest" and used
                    by Makefile.PL

bin/count.pl      : program that counts Ngrams in corpora

bin/statistic.pl  : program that measures association of Ngrams based on
                    count.pl output

Docs/             : directory of documentation

                    README.pod - complete description of NSP
                    FAQ.pod    - frequently asked questions
                    NewStats.pod - how to implement new measures
                    Todo.pod   - our list of things to do
                    Usage.pod  - sample usages (very basic)
                    cicling2003.(ps|pdf) - overview of NSP design

bin/Utils/        : directory that contains several useful programs

                    rank.pl: compare two measures of association
                    kocos.pl: find kth order co-occurrences
                    combig.pl: find unordered counts of bigrams

Testing/          : directory of test scripts for each program in NSP.
                    You can run these to make sure your installation is
                    working, and also to see some sample usages. Each
                    program tested has its own directory within Testing
                    in which you can find a README.txt file that describes
                    the testing process. Please note that "make test" above
                    does *not* run these tests.  They must be run separately
                          after installation is complete.
